        <item>The King is the most important chess piece on the chessboard. If he is checkmated (see objectives, below) the game is over!</item>
        <item>The queen (♕,♛) is the most powerful piece in the game of chess, able to move any number of squares vertically, horizontally or diagonally.</item>
        <item>The bishop has no restrictions in distance for each move, but is limited to diagonal movement. Bishops, like all other pieces except the knight, cannot jump over other pieces</item>
        <item>The knight move is unusual among chess pieces. It moves to a square that is two squares away horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally.</item>
        <item>The rook moves horizontally or vertically, through any number of unoccupied squares (see diagram). As with captures by other pieces, the rook captures by occupying the square on which the enemy piece sits</item>
        <item>The Pawn can never move backwards. The Pawn also has a special move called "En Passant", which you can read about in special moves section below.</item>
